ReQbert - A HTML 5 MSX Q*bert game remake
=========================================

A project by Leonardo Nicolas, Luciano Sother, Gabriel Moreira and 
Felipe Cypriano

Introduction
------------

ReQbert is a browser-based remake of the MSX version of the game Q*bert.

It’s an open source, non-profit project, initiated by three brazilian guys — 
Luciano Sother, Leonardo Nicolas and Gabriel Moreira — as a way to exercise 
their skills in HTML5 and Javascript during their scarce spare-time.

This game was chosen because Sother and Nicolas, in their childhood, were fans 
of MSX games, specially those published by Konami. So, we’ve searched for 
Konami’s MSX titles and this game was the first that we thought is cool enough 
to deserve a remake and, surprisingly, we didn’t find any remake of it.

We’ll post any information about the game’s development progress, such as 
challenges and solutions, decisions being made, tips etc., in the blog, 
allowing interested people to read and give us feedback.

Be welcome and have fun!
